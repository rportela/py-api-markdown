Tesla

Cedes EV crown to BYD

Company Overview

Tesla, Inc. designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and leases fully electric vehicles and energy-
generation and storage systems, and offers services related to its products, such as leasing of
electric vehicles and sales of automotive regulatory credits.  Its automotive products include
the Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model X. Currently, the company produces its electric cars
at gigafactories in the United States, Germany, and China.
Investment Overview

Leading  EV  manufacturer  backed  by  economic  MOATs.  Tesla  is  a  leading  global  EV
manufacturer,  backed  by  its  firm  market  leadership  with  an  estimated  20%  market  share
based on global sales, and healthy automotive margins seen in the industry (FY23 at 17%, on
top end range of peers between 10-20%) which we believe is a commendable feat given that
many legacy OEMs are still witnessing losses in EV production. Tesla's leading market share is
backed by its economic MOAT in EV charging infrastructure and supercharger network, which
has seen rising adoption by other OEM competitors in North America. Furthermore, ongoing
ramp-up and progress in its autonomous driving and other software (e.g., full self-driving aka
FSD) could also emerge as another emerging economic MOAT for Tesla, with Tesla often being
considered as a leader in autonomous driving (aka ADAS) especially among US OEMs.

1Q25 deliveries missed estimates on broad-based weakness. Tesla reported 1Q25 deliveries
of 337k (-32% q/q, -13% y/y) which missed estimates by 11%, coming it at 18% of consensus’
FY25F delivery estimate of 1.87mn. Tesla's Shanghai gigafactory delivered 173k units (which
includes domestic sales and export sales), which shrank by 22% y/y to new low levels since
2Q22 on steep China competition. Separately, 2M25 Tesla registrations in the EU plunged by
43% y/y, despite growth witnessed by the broader EU EV industry at +28% y/y growth. 1Q25
marks the second quarter in which Tesla has lost its #1 BEV leadership position to BYD.

Potential  downside  risks  to  consensus  estimates.  Currently,  consensus  forecast  FY25F
deliveries  at  1.87mn  (+4%  y/y),  gross  automotive  margins  of  13.5%  (down  from  FY24A  of
14.6%), EBIT margins of 8.0% (up from 7.2% in FY24) on cost reduction efforts, and finally, non-
gaap EPS of USD2.59 (+7% y/y). We see some downside risks to consensus estimates given the
latest  1Q25  delivery  numbers,  declining  BEV  market  share  and  weakening  consumer
sentiment towards Tesla. Although Tesla has made efforts to position itself as an "AI" company
over an "EV company", we await for more constructive evidence of its AI execution e.g., FSD
breakthroughs. On a positive note, positive catalysts remain for the counter, such as: FSD win
in China/Europe (L2+, expected in 2025), unsupervised FSD (i.e., implies L3 offering) launch in
US (2025), release of next-gen vehicles (1H25 launch), release of Cybercab robo-taxi (volume
production in 2026), mass production of Semi Truck (2026), and Optimus robot production
(potentially in 2026).

We maintain HOLD with lower TP of USD275. Our TP is based on forward PE of 80x (-0.3SD
below mean) (previous USD300 on forward PE of 106x, +0.3SD above mean). Tesla is currently
trading at forward PE of 94x (at historical mean).

Risks

Firstly,  weaker-than-expected  volume  sales  can  lead  to  downside  risks  to  Tesla's  earnings,
especially  as  EV  competition  heats  up,  noting  rising  competition  and  impressive  EV  sales
growth from China OEM leaders such as BYD. Furthermore, the weakening macroeconomic
environment  in  global/China  markets  can  also  pose  headwinds  to  volume  sales.  Secondly,
margin dilution remains as a risk to Tesla, especially amid the ongoing aggressive price cuts in
the OEM industry.
